## The Problem

Vangst was a cannabis industry staffing marketplace with ambitions to become the industry's talent platform. But they had no formal product function—decisions were made ad-hoc, releases were unpredictable, and the platform struggled to scale. They needed to build a product organization that could support Series B growth.

## The Approach

### Building the Team

I joined as the first product hire and built a 12-person product and engineering organization. This meant:
- Defining roles and career ladders
- Establishing hiring criteria that balanced domain expertise with product skills
- Creating onboarding that got people productive quickly

### Resetting Strategy with the Board

The existing roadmap was a wish list, not a strategy. I worked with the board to:
- Define what success looked like for Series B positioning
- Identify the 3-4 bets that would get us there
- Kill projects that were distracting from those bets

This wasn't popular, but it was necessary.

### Establishing Delivery Rhythms

When I arrived, shipping was monthly at best—and often slipped. I introduced:
- **OKR framework** connecting team work to company goals
- **Two-week sprints** with real commitments
- **Weekly releases** that became continuous deployment
- **Quality gates** that prevented shipping broken features

## Key Decisions

**Platform focus over feature sprawl:** The temptation was to build everything for everyone. I pushed for depth in core use cases over breadth. A staffing marketplace that works brilliantly beats a talent platform that works poorly.

**Burn reduction before growth:** Counter-intuitively, I advocated for reducing burn 40% before the Series B. This meant hard conversations about headcount and scope. But it gave us leverage in fundraising and showed fiscal discipline.

**Engineering autonomy with product accountability:** Engineers made technical decisions. Product owned outcomes. This created faster shipping without sacrificing quality.

## Outcomes

- **Built 12-person product/engineering team** from scratch
- **Transformed shipping cadence** from monthly to continuous weekly releases
- **Reduced burn 40%** while improving velocity
- **Positioned for $19M Series B** raise
- **Platform served 1,200+ cannabis businesses**

## What I Learned

Building a product organization is itself a product problem. You're designing systems, processes, and incentives that shape behavior over time. The meta-lesson: spend as much time designing how the team works as what the team builds.
