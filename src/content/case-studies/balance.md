## The Problem

Banks assume variable income means unpredictable. It doesn't. Servers know exactly what a Friday night versus a Tuesday lunch earns. They're already doing the mental math. Traditional fintech ignores this intelligence and fails 81% of hospitality workers who rely on tips.

## The Approach

Conversational AI that works with what users already know. Not rigid budget categories. Ask "Can I afford rent this month?" and get an honest answer based on actual earning patterns.

## The AI Work

**7-Tool Agentic Architecture**
Safe tools execute automatically. Dangerous tools require user confirmation. AI never moves money without explicit consent.

**LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**
6-dimension scoring framework. Prompt variant testing in production. No shipping prompt changes without running them through eval first.

**Production Infrastructure**
Structured outputs with schema validation. ML observability through Arize. Building hands-on with 2 senior engineers (Rails/Postgres, React Native).

## Key Decisions

**Pivot to conversational AI.** Started as iOS native SaaS. Realized users don't want to categorize transactions. They want to ask questions and get answers.

**Eval-driven development.** Most AI products ship and pray. We built evaluation frameworks that catch regressions before they hit users.

**Safe/dangerous tool classification.** Users stay in control. AI assists, doesn't act autonomously on financial decisions.

## Outcomes

60% retention in a category where 80% churn is typical. Serving 81% tipped workers. Production-grade agentic architecture with measurable quality metrics.

This isn't AI-curious. This is production AI with engineering rigor.
