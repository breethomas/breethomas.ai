## The Problem

Partytrick had been in development for over two years with nothing to show for it. Design and engineering teams were misaligned, spending was bloated, and the market window was closing. They needed someone to come in, cut through the noise, and ship.

## The Approach

### Ruthless Prioritization

The first week was about understanding what actually mattered. I audited every feature in the backlog, every design in Figma, and every piece of technical debt. Then I cut 70% of it.

What remained:
- Core event planning functionality
- Invitation system
- Marketing site to drive signups

Everything else was either post-launch or never.

### Team Alignment

The real problem wasn't technical—it was organizational. Design was building features that engineering couldn't ship. Engineering was making architectural decisions without product input. Everyone was busy, but nothing was moving.

I established:
- **Weekly ship goals** with clear ownership
- **Daily standups** focused on blockers, not status
- **Shared KPIs** that made success measurable

### Cost Control

While shipping, we also needed to extend runway. I identified redundant tools, renegotiated contracts, and paused non-essential spending. This wasn't about being cheap—it was about buying time to prove market fit.

## Key Decisions

**Ship the MVP, not the vision:** The team had been trying to build a comprehensive event platform. I reframed it as "let's prove people will use this for one type of event first."

**Design freeze after week 2:** No new designs after the first two weeks. Everything had to be in build mode. This forced decisions and prevented endless iteration.

**Public launch date:** I announced the launch date to stakeholders before we were ready. Constraints create focus.

## Outcomes

- **Full platform shipped in <40 days** (event planning, invitations, marketing site)
- **60% reduction in burn** through cost optimization
- **Clear go-to-market strategy** with measurable traction metrics
- **Scalable B2B framework** for future growth

## What I Learned

Sometimes the best product decision is to stop deciding and start shipping. Two years of deliberation produced nothing. Forty days of focused execution produced a launched product. The market doesn't care about your process—it cares about what you ship.
