          <p>
            My career happened in thirds.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, marketing. DTC brands like Oakley, North Face, and Beats by Dre before Apple bought them. Three Super Bowl campaigns with Audi. These weren't just advertising. We had engineering teams building software for these brands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I learned to code. Took a detour to Turing School because I wanted to understand how things actually get built. Founded the Denver chapter of Girl Develop It and taught women to code on weekends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketing foundation plus shipping production code led to product. I've been doing product since before it became the discipline it is today.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm the one you call when turnarounds need to happen and shit needs to get done. Startups, Fortune 500s, stalled products, scaling teams. I've done it across verticals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engineers want to work with me. I speak their language, understand their constraints, make tough calls, and protect their focus. I build products WITH my team, not just for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't rely on assumptions. I study what people actually do. User empathy isn't a phase of the project. It's how I think.
          </p>
          <p>
            My undergrad was art studio. I painted and drew my way through college. Then law school. Passed the Colorado bar. That breadth made me dangerous: creative thinking, critical thinking, logical reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't write memos nobody reads. I build. I ship. I iterate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Why AI -->
        <div class="mt-12 p-8 bg-bg-surface rounded-lg">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Why AI</h2>
          <div class="space-y-4 text-text-secondary">
            <p>
              For years, the dynamic between design, engineering, and product got stagnant. AI flipped all of that on its head.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not just about what we can build now. It's about how it's changed the way we work together. Leveled the playing field. Made collaboration interesting again.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's what I'm passionate about.
            </p>
